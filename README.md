# Shortest-Distance
Algorithms Final Project -- Sp2015

Primary Methods:
--Produce set of pairs (tuples) and save them to a text file.
--Read set of pairs (tuples) from a text file.
--Find shortest distance between two points in set of pairs (tuples).
--Find the two points with the shortest distance between them in set of pairs (tuples).
----Exhaustive
----Bottom-up recursive
# Maybe only one of the last two? Might be too redundant.

Need to simplify working with pairs (tuples). I have #define statements, but do we want to rewrite any methods? Food for thought.

Questions to answer:
--Do we want to find a point of failure for exhaustive search? # Dependent on memory, but might be interesting. Would want to do on 32-bit OS.
--What range do we want for our points?
--Do we want to work on negative values? Is there any downsides to doing so?
--Do we want to work on integers or floats?
